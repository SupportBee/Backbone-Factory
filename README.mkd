Backbone Factory
================

Introduction
------------

Backbone Factory is a small javascript library for creating [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) objects for testing your code. It has no external dependency. 

The API is heavily inspired by the awesome [Factory Girl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl). 


Installation
------------

To use it, just [download](https://github.com/SupportBee/Backbone-Factory/raw/master/public/javascripts/backbone-factory.js) the file and include it in your testing setup.  
Usage
-----

Lets say you have two Backbone models, Post and User

```javascript
var User = Backbone.Model.extend({

  name: null,
  email: null

});

var Post = Backbone.Model.extend({

  defaults: {
    title: 'Default Title'
  }

});
```

### Defining Factories

To define factories for them

```javascript
var postFactory = BackboneFactory.define('post', Post);
var userFactory = BackboneFactory.define('user', User);
```

### Using Factories

To use these factories, 

```javscript
this.postObject = BackboneFactory.create('post');
this.userObject = BackboneFactory.create('user');
```

This will create objects using the [defaults](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Model-defaults) you have in your class definitions.


### Defining Sequences 

```javascript
var emailSequence = BackboneFactory.define_sequence('email', function(n){
        return "person"+n+"@example.com"; 
      });
```

### Using Sequences

```javascript
var email = BackboneFactory.next('email') // person1@example.com
```

### Defining Factories with defaults

```javascript
var userFactory = BackboneFactory.define('user', User, function(){
                                   return {
                                     name : 'Backbone User',
                                     email: BackboneFactory.next('person_email')
                                      };
                                    }
                                   );
```

### Overriding defaults when creating objects

```javascript
var userWithEmail = BackboneFactory.create('user', function(){
                                             return {
                                                email: 'overriden@example.com'
                                              };
                            });
 ```
